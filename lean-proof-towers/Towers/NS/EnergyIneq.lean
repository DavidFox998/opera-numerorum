  # Towers.NS.EnergyIneq

  **Schema file plus three trivial bricks (Task #56, 2026-05-26).**
  This file pins the Clay 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes global
  regularity conjecture as a future formalisation target, using a
  structured (rather than single-`sorry`) schema. As of Task #56 it
  also carries three trio-clean bricks (`H1Norm_zero`,
  `HasFiniteEnergy_zero`, `H1Norm_nonneg`) that exercise the schema
  defs concretized in Task #51. As of Task #51
  (2026-05-26) the two previously `sorry`-backed schema defs
  (`H1Norm`, `HasFiniteEnergy`) have been replaced by concrete,
  minimal, mathlib-backed stand-ins, so the file is now
  `sorry`-free. mathlib v4.12.0 still ships none of the prerequisite
  PDE machinery (Sobolev spaces, Leray-Hopf weak solutions,
  divergence-free L² constraint, energy inequality); the new
  defs are honest placeholders, not the real PDE quantities.

  Because no body is `sorry` any more, `#print axioms
  NS_global_regular_statement` no longer displays `[sorryAx]`. The
  statement type-checks, but its *content* is the placeholder
  schema below, not the Clay conjecture.

  ## Deviations from Plan #51 literal spec

  Plan #51 as written contains an import and an identifier that do
  not exist in mathlib v4.12.0, and a structure-field syntax that is
  not valid in Lean 4. The following deviations were forced:

    1. `import Mathlib.Analysis.Distribution.SobolevSpace` **OMITTED.**
       This file does not exist in mathlib v4.12.0. The closest
       available is `Mathlib.Analysis.FunctionalSpaces.SobolevInequality`,
       which provides the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev *inequality* on
       `Lp`, not an `H^k` vector-field Sobolev space type with a
       `.norm` lookup. The TODO on `H1Norm` still names the intended
       future definition.
    2. `import Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.ContDiff.Defs` **ADDED** (not
       in Plan #51) so that `ContDiff ℝ ⊤ (S.u t)` in the global-
       regularity statement elaborates. Also `Mathlib.Analysis.
       InnerProductSpace.PiL2` for `EuclideanSpace`.
    3. `HasFiniteEnergy` was used in Plan #51 but was deleted from
       `Towers/NS/Divergence.lean` in the previous step (when we
       stripped the placeholder axioms). Added back **here** as a
       local `def := sorry` so this file is self-contained.
    4. `VelocityField` declared as **`abbrev`** rather than `def`, so
       `S.u t` (where `S.u : VelocityField`) reduces to a function
       application on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)`
       without `@[reducible]` annotations elsewhere.
    5. Structure-field syntax `h_div_free : sorry` is **not** valid
       Lean 4 — a structure field's right-hand side after the colon
       must be a type, not a term. Replaced with `h_div_free : Prop`
       (an opaque proposition field) plus a docstring TODO naming the
       intended constraint. The semantic effect is identical: the
       proposition is left abstract, just at the field-type level
       rather than via a sorry-value default.
    6. `∞` (used as `ContDiff ℝ ∞ ...`) is replaced with `⊤`, which
       is the canonical mathlib spelling of "infinitely smooth" in
       `WithTop ℕ` and avoids notation-scope issues.

  ## What this file is NOT

  * Not a proof of NS global regularity.
  * Not a precise Lean statement (placeholders are opaque).
  * **Not a brick.** `scripts/check-towers.sh` explicitly excludes
    this file from `BRICKS`. The 7 real bricks (`divergence_add`,
    `divergence_smul`, etc.) do NOT import this file, so their axiom
    footprints remain in `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` —
    verified post-build.

  ## What this file IS

  * Stable citable Lean identifiers
    (`TheoremaAureum.Towers.NS.LeraySolution`,
    `TheoremaAureum.Towers.NS.NS_global_regular_statement`) that
    future plans can point to as the future target.
  * A flagged TODO surface — every `sorry` is paired with a `TODO:`
    naming the mathlib gap.

  **Task #51 implementation note (2026-05-26).** The two schema
  defs below (`H1Norm`, `HasFiniteEnergy`) were previously
  `sorry`-backed placeholders, paired with an audit comment that
  declined every candidate mathlib replacement as either a
  disguised stub or a "substantively misleading" Clay-conjecture
  impersonation. Per Task #51, that policy is reversed: each def
  is now a concrete, minimal, mathlib-backed stand-in:

    * `H1Norm u t := ‖u t 0‖` — the Euclidean norm of the velocity
      field evaluated at the spatial origin at time `t`. Real-
      valued, depends on both `u` and `t`. Not the H¹ Sobolev norm.
    * `HasFiniteEnergy u₀ := ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ x, ‖u₀ 0 x‖ ≤ M` — bounded
      amplitude of `u₀` at time `0`. Real predicate. Not the
      L² energy bound `‖u₀(0,·)‖_{L²} < ∞`.

  These let `NS_global_regular_statement` type-check without
  `sorryAx`. The Navier-Stokes tower remains Open per

  ## Task #56 (2026-05-26) — first load-bearing bricks on the
  concretized NS energy schema.

  The three theorems below exercise `H1Norm` and `HasFiniteEnergy`
  (Task #51 concretizations). They are the NS analogue of YM's
  `IsEigenstate_zero_zero`: minimal demonstrations that the
  post-refactor schema defs are real, usable mathlib-flavoured
  surfaces rather than opaque `sorry`-defs.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** None of these advance the NS tower
  past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). They prove only
  that the *placeholder* `H1Norm` (Euclidean norm at the origin) and
  *placeholder* `HasFiniteEnergy` (bounded amplitude at `t = 0`) have
  the trivial expected behaviour on the zero velocity field, and that
  the placeholder `H1Norm` is nonneg. They are NOT statements about
  the H¹ Sobolev norm, the L² energy bound, or any Leray-Hopf
  solution.

  theorem must be either axiom-free or use only the classical trio
  `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.

  ## Task #62 (2026-05-26) — second wave of NS energy schema bricks.

  Three more trio-clean bricks on the Task #51 NS schema, each
  referencing `H1Norm` / `HasFiniteEnergy` on *non-zero* / fully-
  general inputs (not just the zero velocity field). This is the
  NS analogue of YM Task #55's wave that proved
  `YMHamiltonian_one_eq_twelve` and friends.

    * `H1Norm_eq_norm_apply_zero` — the named unfolder
      `H1Norm u t = ‖u t 0‖` for any `u`, `t`.
    * `HasFiniteEnergy_of_bounded_zero` — given a uniform bound
      `∀ x, ‖u₀ 0 x‖ ≤ M`, conclude `HasFiniteEnergy u₀`. Real
      hypothesis, not vacuous.
    * `HasFiniteEnergy_const` — every constant-in-spacetime
      velocity field `(fun _ _ => c)` has finite placeholder energy,
      with explicit witness `M = ‖c‖`. References a non-zero input.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** None of these advance the NS tower
  past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). They are not
  statements about the H¹ Sobolev norm, the L² energy bound, or
  any Leray-Hopf solution; they prove only that the *placeholder*
  `H1Norm` (Euclidean norm at the origin) and *placeholder*
  `HasFiniteEnergy` (bounded amplitude at `t = 0`) have the
  expected algebraic behaviour across all velocity fields.

  ## Task #69 (2026-05-26) — combinator bricks on the NS energy schema.

  Two non-trivial combinators on the Task #51 `HasFiniteEnergy`
  placeholder, neither specialised to a constant or zero velocity
  field. They are the NS analogue of YM Task #61's
  `YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve`: actual *combinators* on the schema
  rather than unfolders/instantiations.

    * `HasFiniteEnergy_add` — pointwise sum of two finite-energy
      velocity fields is finite-energy. Witness `M₁ + M₂` via the
      triangle inequality `‖u 0 x + v 0 x‖ ≤ ‖u 0 x‖ + ‖v 0 x‖`.
    * `HasFiniteEnergy_of_smul_bounded` — for any scalar profile
      `f : ℝ³ → ℝ` bounded by 1 in absolute value and any fixed
      vector `c`, the smoothly varying field
      `fun _ x => f x • c` has finite placeholder energy with
      witness `M = ‖c‖`. The input `f` is genuinely non-constant
      (any bounded ℝ³ → ℝ profile works), so this is the first
      brick that exercises `HasFiniteEnergy` on a smoothly-varying
      field rather than a constant.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** None of these advance the NS tower
  past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). They are not
  statements about the H¹ Sobolev norm, the L² energy bound, or
  any Leray-Hopf solution; they prove only that the *placeholder*
  `HasFiniteEnergy` (bounded amplitude at `t = 0`) is closed under
  pointwise addition and is satisfied by `‖f‖_∞ ≤ 1`-bounded
  scalar profiles times a fixed vector.

  ## Task #70 (2026-05-26) — name the "energy never grows" predicate.

  The `LeraySolution` structure carries a bare-`Prop` field
  `h_energy` whose docstring TODO names the intended constraint
  `∀ t, H1Norm u t ≤ H1Norm u₀ 0`. Task #62 made `H1Norm`
  load-bearing on arbitrary inputs, so this batch upgrades that
  intention to an actual named predicate, `EnergyMonotone u u₀`,
  on `(VelocityField, VelocityField)`. The structure field
  `h_energy : Prop` is intentionally **left as-is** — flipping its
  type to `EnergyMonotone S.u u₀` would change the structure's
  shape and break every existing `LeraySolution` constructor in
  the codebase (and, more importantly, would make
  `LeraySolution` carry a real, currently-unprovable energy
  constraint without any of the supporting PDE machinery). The
  predicate is exposed as a standalone `def` an external reader
  can `#check` and that future plans can point to.

    * `EnergyMonotone u u₀ : Prop` — `∀ t, H1Norm u t ≤ H1Norm u₀ 0`,
      the explicit placeholder-flavoured energy inequality.
    * `EnergyMonotone_refl u₀` — `EnergyMonotone u₀ u₀` via `le_refl`,
      trivial witness on the diagonal.
    * `EnergyMonotone_zero u₀` — `EnergyMonotone 0 u₀` via
      `H1Norm_zero` + `H1Norm_nonneg`, the second trivial witness
      that exercises the Task #56 brick `H1Norm_zero` and the
      Task #56 brick `H1Norm_nonneg`.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** This brick does NOT advance the NS
  tower past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). It is
  **not** the Leray-Hopf energy inequality. `H1Norm` is the
  Task #51 placeholder (Euclidean norm of `u t 0`), not the real
  H¹ Sobolev norm. The predicate `EnergyMonotone` is therefore a
  placeholder-flavoured pointwise-at-the-origin monotonicity, not
  an L² / H¹ energy bound.

    *diagonal* shape `EnergyMonotone u₀ u₀` reduces (after
    unfolding) to `∀ t, H1Norm u₀ t ≤ H1Norm u₀ 0`, which is
    again non-trivial. So the genuinely trivial witness is at the
    *constant* level: any `u₀` whose `H1Norm` is constant in `t`
    satisfies `EnergyMonotone u₀ u₀` by `le_refl`. We do NOT

  ## Task #78 (2026-05-26) — spatial-translation invariance of the
  placeholder finite-energy predicate.

  Continues the Task #69 combinator wave on `HasFiniteEnergy`. Where
  Task #69 proved closure under pointwise addition
  (`HasFiniteEnergy_add`) and under a `‖f‖_∞ ≤ 1`-bounded scalar
  profile times a fixed vector (`HasFiniteEnergy_of_smul_bounded`),
  this brick proves closure under **rigid spatial translation**: if
  `u₀` has finite placeholder energy with witness `M`, then so does
  the shifted field `fun t x => u₀ t (x + a)` for any fixed
  translation `a : ℝ³`, reusing the same witness `M`.

  This is the first NS combinator that looks like a real PDE
  symmetry (`u₀ ↦ u₀(·, · + a)`) rather than a pure norm-algebra
  fact (triangle inequality / homogeneity of `‖·‖`). The proof is
  one line: for every spatial point `x`, `‖u₀ 0 (x + a)‖ ≤ M`
  follows immediately from `hMu (x + a)`.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** This does NOT advance the NS tower
  past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). `HasFiniteEnergy`
  is still the Task #51 placeholder (bounded amplitude at `t = 0`),
  not the L² energy bound. Translation invariance of the
  *placeholder* predicate is not translation invariance of the real
  energy. The brick exercises real PDE-flavoured surface vocabulary
  on a placeholder schema, nothing more.

  ## Task #89 (2026-05-26) — rotational invariance of the placeholder
  finite-energy predicate.

  Continues the Task #78 PDE-symmetry wave on `HasFiniteEnergy`. Where
  Task #78 proved closure under rigid spatial translation
  (`HasFiniteEnergy_translate`), this brick proves closure under
  **rigid spatial rotation**: composing the velocity field with any
  linear isometry `R : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3) →ₗᵢ[ℝ]
  EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)` on the spatial argument preserves the
  placeholder finite-energy witness with the *same* `M`. Together
  with Task #78, this pushes the schema toward the full Euclidean
  symmetry group on ℝ³ (translations + SO(3)) without leaving the
  placeholder regime.

  The proof is one line: for every spatial point `x`,
  `‖u₀ 0 (R x)‖ ≤ M` follows immediately from `hMu (R x)`. The
  isometry hypothesis on `R` is not actually used in the proof
  (the bounded-amplitude predicate only cares about reindexing,
  not norm preservation); it is in the signature to keep the
  symmetry-group flavour honest. Once `HasFiniteEnergy` is upgraded
  to the real L² bound `‖u₀(0,·)‖_{L²} < ∞`, the isometry
  hypothesis WILL become load-bearing (change-of-variables under
  an orthogonal map preserves Lebesgue measure exactly because
  `|det R| = 1`).

  **Honest scoping reminder.** This does NOT advance the NS tower
  past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). `HasFiniteEnergy`

  ## Task #100 (2026-05-27) — time-translation invariance of the
  placeholder finite-energy predicate.

  Completes the rigid-motion symmetry trio on the placeholder NS
  energy schema started by Task #78 (spatial translation
  `HasFiniteEnergy_translate`) and Task #89 (rotation
  `HasFiniteEnergy_rotate`). The remaining elementary PDE symmetry
  on the spacetime domain is **time translation**: shifting the
  velocity field by a fixed time offset `s` should also preserve
  the placeholder finite-energy witness.

  **Honest scope.** Unlike spatial translation / rotation —
  where the bounded-amplitude predicate at `t = 0` reindexes
  trivially under reindexing of `x` — `HasFiniteEnergy u₀ :=
  ∃ M, ∀ x, ‖u₀ 0 x‖ ≤ M` only sees `u₀` at `t = 0`. The shifted
  field `fun t x => u₀ (t + s) x` evaluated at `t = 0` is
  `u₀ s x`, NOT `u₀ 0 x`. We therefore cannot pretend a bound at
  `t = 0` propagates to time `s` (that would silently assume the
  full Leray energy inequality the schema does not yet have). The
  honest statement is *conditional*: given a uniform bound on `u₀`
  *at time `s`*, the time-shifted field is finite-energy with the
  same witness `M`. The proof is one line — for every `x`,
  `‖u₀ s x‖ ≤ M` is the hypothesis applied at `x`.

  Together with Task #78 (`HasFiniteEnergy_translate`) and Task
  #89 (`HasFiniteEnergy_rotate`), this completes the rigid-motion
  symmetry trio (spatial translation + rotation + time
  translation) on the placeholder schema. It does NOT advance the
  NS tower past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3).
  `HasFiniteEnergy` is still the Task #51 placeholder (bounded
  amplitude at `t = 0`), not the L² energy bound; time-translation
  closure of the *placeholder* predicate is not time-translation
  invariance of the real energy.

  Axiom-footprint contract (per `scripts/check-towers.sh`): the
  theorem must be either axiom-free or use only the classical trio

    placeholder energy with witness `M`. The hypothesis is at time
    `s` (not `0`) because the placeholder predicate

  ## Task #101 (2026-05-27) — full Euclidean motion invariance of the
  placeholder finite-energy predicate.

  Tasks #78 and #89 landed the two generators of the rigid Euclidean
  motion group E(3) on `HasFiniteEnergy`: spatial translation
  (`HasFiniteEnergy_translate`, `u₀ ↦ u₀(·, · + a)`) and linear
  isometry / rotation (`HasFiniteEnergy_rotate`, `u₀ ↦ u₀(·, R ·)`).
  The natural composite is invariance under a full Euclidean motion
  `x ↦ R x + a` — what an actual Galilean / rigid-body change of frame
  on the spatial slice looks like. Landing the composite brick
  documents that the schema really does respect the full symmetry
  group, not just its generators in isolation.

  The proof is one line: chain `HasFiniteEnergy_rotate` (to reduce
  closure under `x ↦ R x + a` to closure under `x ↦ x + a` on the
  pre-rotated field) and then `HasFiniteEnergy_translate`. The
  composite reuses the *same* witness `M` as the original `u₀`.

  **Honest scope.** This does NOT advance the NS tower past
  `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). `HasFiniteEnergy` is
  still the Task #51 placeholder (bounded amplitude at `t = 0`), not
  the L² energy bound. Full Euclidean-motion closure of the
  *placeholder* predicate is not Euclidean-motion invariance of the
  real energy.

  theorem must be either axiom-free or use only the classical trio

  ## Task #117 (2026-05-27) — time-reversal invariance of the
  placeholder finite-energy predicate.

  Tasks #78 (spatial translation), #89 (rotation), and #100 (time
  translation) covered the rigid-motion symmetry trio on the
  placeholder NS energy schema. The natural next elementary symmetry
  on the spacetime domain is **time reversal**: replacing
  `u₀(t, x)` with `u₀(-t, x)` should also preserve the placeholder
  finite-energy witness.

  **Honest scope.** The placeholder predicate
  `HasFiniteEnergy u₀ := ∃ M, ∀ x, ‖u₀ 0 x‖ ≤ M` only inspects the
  velocity field at `t = 0`. Time reversal `t ↦ -t` fixes `t = 0`
  (`-0 = 0`), so the time-reversed field
  `fun t x => u₀ (-t) x` evaluated at `t = 0` is *definitionally*
  `u₀ 0 x`. The proof is therefore unconditional and one line:
  reuse the original witness `M` directly, with `hM x` unchanged.

  This is distinct from Task #100 (`HasFiniteEnergy_time_translate`),
  which was *conditional* on a uniform bound at the shifted time `s`
  precisely because `t = 0 ↦ s ≠ 0` under translation. Reversal is
  the rare time-axis symmetry that is honestly unconditional on this
  placeholder, because `t = 0` is its fixed point.

  Honest disclaimer: this is NOT the full physical time reversal of
  Navier-Stokes (which would also flip the sign of the velocity,
  `u₀(t, x) ↦ -u₀(-t, x)`, since velocity reverses under time
  reversal). The "with sign flip" variant would land equally cleanly
  here (`‖-u₀ 0 x‖ = ‖u₀ 0 x‖` by `norm_neg`) but the unsigned
  variant is the shape that lands one-line trio-clean and matches
  the surface-level reindexing flavour of #78 / #89 / #100. The full
  signed reversal is a future brick once `HasFiniteEnergy` is
  upgraded toward real PDE content.

  Does NOT advance the NS tower past `Status: Open` (see
  `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). `HasFiniteEnergy` is still the Task #51
  placeholder (bounded amplitude at `t = 0`), not the L² energy
  bound; time-reversal closure of the *placeholder* predicate is
  not time-reversal invariance of the real energy.

  theorem must be either axiom-free or use only the classical trio
