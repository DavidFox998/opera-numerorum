  # Towers.BSD.MordellWeil

  **This file does NOT prove the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture
  (BSD), the rank formula, the order-of-vanishing equation, or any
  rank statement about a specific elliptic curve.** It names the
  trivial commutativity brick of the Mordell-Weil group in the BSD
  context (delegating to mathlib's existing `AddCommGroup` instance
  on `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point`) and pins the *statement* of
  the BSD rank conjecture as a future target.

  Status (cf. `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 4. 280-curve cohort):

  - `MordellWeilGroup E`     — alias for `E.toAffine.Point` over a field `K`.
                                Inherits mathlib's `AddCommGroup` instance.
  - `MordellWeilGroup.add_comm`
                              — trivial commutativity brick, **proved**.
                                Discharged by invoking mathlib's existing
                                `_root_.add_comm` on the inherited
                                `AddCommGroup` structure. Axiom footprint =
                                subset of mathlib's classical core
                                `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`,
                                no research-grade axioms. (Verified by
                                `scripts/check-towers.sh`.)
  - `BSD_rank_statement`     — **statement schema only.** No proof. The
                                rank form of BSD (`rank E(ℚ) =
                                ord_{s=1} L(E, s)`), expressed via
                                explicit placeholder predicates because
                                mathlib v4.12.0 does not define
                                `L(E, s)` for elliptic curves over `ℚ`.
                                Closing it requires both (a) a real
                                L-function definition and (b) the full
                                BSD proof, neither of which is in scope.

  Imports mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point` so the brick
  actually mentions the genuine group of nonsingular rational
  points — not a `Prop := True` placeholder. The existing
  tautological `TheoremaAureum.GRH_E_143a1 : Prop := True` and the
  N=397-specific `TheoremaAureum.M9_WeilTransfer_All` in
  `lean-proof/TheoremaAureum/` are deliberately untouched; this file
  lives in a fresh `TheoremaAureum.Towers.BSD` namespace so there is
  no name collision and no implicit relabelling of a tautology as a
  theorem about the general statement.

  **Honesty note on the rank-statement schema.** Mathlib v4.12.0
  does not provide `L(E, s)` for elliptic curves over `ℚ` — neither
  the analytic L-series of the modular form attached to `E` nor the
  Hasse-Weil L-function from the Euler product. Mathlib also does
  not yet prove Mordell-Weil for `E(ℚ)`, so an algebraic rank as a
  natural number is not yet a derived notion.

  We refuse to invent a concrete placeholder L-function (e.g.
  `fun _ => 0`) because doing so would let `BSD_rank_statement`
  become trivially true or trivially false. We also refuse to
  universally quantify over `rank`, `IsLFunctionOf`, and
  `orderOfVanishing` as ordinary parameters — that *also* lets an
  adversarial instantiation (e.g. picking `IsLFunctionOf := fun _
  _ => True` together with `MordellWeilRank := fun _ => 0` and
  `orderOfVanishing := fun _ _ => 1`) immediately refute the
  schema, again unrelated to BSD.

  The honest move is to declare the three placeholders as fresh
  *axioms* (opaque constants) at file scope. The schema is then a
  real proposition about three named opaque constants — neither
  provable by `True.intro` / `decide` / `rfl`, nor refutable by
  instantiation, because the constants have no reducible body.
  Closing the schema in its current form would *itself* require new
  axioms (which the surrounding check would catch). The real path
  forward is for future plans to (a) define `L(E, s)` for elliptic
  curves in mathlib, (b) prove Mordell-Weil over `ℚ` so
  `MordellWeilRank` becomes a real `def`, (c) replace each of the
  three axioms below with the real `def`, and only then attempt to
  prove the schema as a theorem.

  The axioms below are deliberately confined to this single file
  and do **not** appear in the axiom footprint of
  `MordellWeilGroup.add_comm` (the brick that `check-towers.sh`
  verifies). They are honest TODO markers, not load-bearing
  assumptions of any proved theorem in this repo.

open WeierstrassCurve

/-- The **Mordell-Weil group** of a Weierstrass elliptic curve `E`
    over a field `K`: the additive group of nonsingular `K`-rational
    points on the affine model of `E`.

    This is a thin alias around mathlib's
    `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point`. The full `AddCommGroup`
    structure (zero, negation, addition, all group axioms including
    commutativity) is inherited from mathlib's
    `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.instAddCommGroup`. -/
def MordellWeilGroup {K : Type*} [Field K] (E : WeierstrassCurve K) : Type _ :=
  E.toAffine.Point

namespace MordellWeilGroup

/-- Mathlib's `AddCommGroup` instance on `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point`,
    surfaced under our alias. This is a delegation, not a new instance:
    `Affine.Point` is reducibly the same as `MordellWeilGroup`, so the
    mathlib instance applies directly. -/
noncomputable instance {K : Type*} [Field K] (E : WeierstrassCurve K) :
    AddCommGroup (MordellWeilGroup E) :=
  inferInstanceAs (AddCommGroup E.toAffine.Point)

/-- **Mordell-Weil commutativity (trivial brick).**

    For any field `K`, any Weierstrass elliptic curve `E` over `K`,
    and any two `K`-rational points `P Q` on the affine model of `E`,
    the group operation is commutative: `P + Q = Q + P`.

    The proof is a one-line delegation to mathlib's
    `_root_.add_comm` on the inherited `AddCommGroup` structure.
    This lemma is **not** new mathematics — it is mathlib's
    commutativity theorem, re-named in the BSD context so future
    plans have a stable Mordell-Weil-flavoured name to invoke
    instead of dropping into the underlying `Affine.Point` API.

    Axiom footprint: subset of mathlib's classical core
    `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (verified by
    `scripts/check-towers.sh`). No research-grade axioms. -/

/-- Placeholder for "`L_E` is the analytic L-function of the
    elliptic curve `E` over `ℚ`."

    **TODO** (open mathlib-scale work, separate from BSD itself):
    replace this axiom with the real definition of the L-function
    attached to an elliptic curve — either via the modular form
    attached to `E` (modularity theorem) or via the Hasse-Weil Euler
    product. Mathlib v4.12.0 has neither.

    Declared as a fresh axiom (not as `def ... := True` or
    `def ... := False`) so that `BSD_rank_statement` below is not
    closeable by instantiating this predicate trivially. -/
axiom IsLFunctionOf : (ℂ → ℂ) → WeierstrassCurve ℚ → Prop

/-- Placeholder for the analytic order of vanishing of a complex
    function at a point in `ℂ`.

    **TODO**: replace with the real `Function.orderOfVanishing` once
    mathlib's complex-analysis library defines it for analytic
    functions on neighbourhoods in `ℂ`.

    Declared as a fresh axiom for the same reason as
    `IsLFunctionOf`. -/
axiom orderOfVanishingAt : (ℂ → ℂ) → ℂ → ℕ

/-- Placeholder for the algebraic Mordell-Weil rank of `E(ℚ)`, i.e.
    the `ℤ`-rank of the finitely generated abelian group of rational
    points.

    **TODO**: replace with mathlib's eventual rank function on the
    Mordell-Weil group once (a) Mordell-Weil for `E(ℚ)` is formalized
    in mathlib and (b) `MordellWeilGroup E` has been shown to be a
    finitely generated abelian group.

    Declared as a fresh axiom for the same reason as
    `IsLFunctionOf`. -/
axiom MordellWeilRank : WeierstrassCurve ℚ → ℕ

/-- **Statement** of the rank form of the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer
    conjecture, expressed in terms of the placeholder axioms
    `IsLFunctionOf`, `orderOfVanishingAt`, and `MordellWeilRank`.

    Classical form (Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer, 1965): for any elliptic
    curve `E / ℚ`,

      `rank (E(ℚ)) = ord_{s = 1} L(E, s)`.

    Schema form below: for any `E : WeierstrassCurve ℚ` and any
    `L_E : ℂ → ℂ` that is "the L-function of `E`" in the placeholder
    sense, `MordellWeilRank E = orderOfVanishingAt L_E 1`.

    **Statement only. Do NOT close with `True.intro`, `trivial`,
    `sorry`, or any tautology.** With the three placeholder axioms
    above declared as opaque constants, this schema is not closeable
    by any structural trick — proving or refuting it would require
    new axioms about the placeholders (and the surrounding
    `check-towers.sh` axiom-footprint check would catch any such
    misuse on a derived theorem).

    Proving this — or even stating it precisely — requires both a
    formal `L(E, s)` definition (open mathlib-scale work) and the
    BSD proof itself (a Clay Millennium Problem, open since 1965).
    The schema below is the *future target*, not a theorem. -/
def BSD_rank_statement : Prop :=
  ∀ (E : WeierstrassCurve ℚ) (L_E : ℂ → ℂ),
    IsLFunctionOf L_E E →
      MordellWeilRank E = orderOfVanishingAt L_E 1
