# check-lean-proof.sh — Guard against silent Lean proof drift.
#
# Re-runs `lean-proof/regenerate.sh`, which rebuilds the Lean proof and
# self-checks that `main_theorem`, `H2_WeilTransfer`, and
# `M9_WeilTransfer_All` still report "does not depend on any axioms".
# Exits non-zero if the proof itself has drifted (i.e. the axiom debt
# check inside regenerate.sh failed). VERIFY.txt is regenerated as a
# side-effect; we don't compare it against the committed copy because it
# embeds volatile metadata (date / host) that would cause spurious diffs.
#
# Intended triggers:
#   - registered `validation` command (`lean-proof`) for CI-style checks
#   - invoked from `scripts/post-merge.sh` so any merge that touches
#     `lean-proof/**` is verified before it can silently ship
#
# Behaviour when `lake` (Lean 4) is not installed:
#   - in strict mode (env `STRICT_LEAN_CHECK=1`, used by the `lean-proof`
#     validation workflow / CI gate) the script FAILS, so the proof can never
#     ship without being re-verified
#   - in non-strict mode (the default, used by the local post-merge hook) the
#     script prints a clearly visible warning to stderr and exits 0 so merges
#     aren't blocked in environments without a Lean toolchain. The warning
#     still surfaces in the post-merge log so the gap is visible.
