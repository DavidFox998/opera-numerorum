**Full history → `docs/CHANGELOG.md`** (per-batch wall-jump tables, tactic
notes, proof sketches, drift footnotes, env vars, stack, where-things-live,
gotchas). `replit.md` is the live-ops doc; the CHANGELOG is the version
history. Roadmap → `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Current status — 2026-06-02

- **BUILD_MANIFEST v2.3 VERIFIED (2026-06-02; author D. Fox, ORCID
  0009-0008-1290-6105).** All four H4 modules re-verified in order A → A.1 → E →
  D: core builds, every leaf compiles EXIT 0, no forbidden terms, `axioms=0`,
  `sorry=0`, mathlib OFF. Per-module `data.json` now carries `author: "D. Fox"`.

  | Module | File | Status | SHA-256 (file) | Key #eval |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | A `H4Core` | `H4Core.lean` / `H4_Strata_Ztau.lean` | PROVEN | `aa8c1180…a6ce` / `69bdcd6c…ca34` | `symOf[2,3,19,191,1000000001119]=[120,20,2,2,1]` |
  | A.1 `H4Boundary` | `H4_Boundary.lean` | EMPIRICAL | `05bf6022…c871a` | `digit_len 1000000001119=13`, `sym=1`; 9 samples, 0 ctrex |
  | E `H4TimeBound` | `H4_TimeBound.lean` | EMPIRICAL | `5f172143…f8a7` | `10^12<3^40=true`; 6×13-digit `sym=1` |
  | D `H4Derivation` | `H4_Derivation.lean` | CONJECTURE | `e21ae1ba…e2b2` | `C13_Law_Open` UNPROVEN; empirical 6/6 = true |

  **SHA notes:** D file hash matches the manifest exactly (`e21ae1ba…e2b2`). The
  manifest's A SHA `48536d9d…ba997` is the prose milestone RECORD hash, NOT a
  file hash — the real file hashes are tabled above (recorded honestly in
  `H4Core.data.json`). **`C13_Law_Open` stays a CONJECTURE (empirical 6/6), NOT
  asserted as a theorem.** No `∀`-law claimed; no YM/mass-gap/Surface-#1 result.
- **H4 strata modules A / A.1 / E / D (2026-06-02; full detail → `docs/CHANGELOG.md`).**
  Shared mathlib-free engine `Towers/YM/H4Core.lean` + four leaves over the real
  W(H₄) point-stabilizer geometry (the v2.3 table above is the live snapshot).
  KEY HONEST FACTS: `symOf [2,3,19,191,1000000001119] = [120,20,2,2,1]` (NOT
  David's `[120,20,20,2,1]`; `symOf 19 = 2`); proposed `P5 = 10000000001119` has
  `digit_len 14` NOT 13 (real 13-digit boundary prime is `1000000001119`); `10^12
  < 3^40` (axiom-free), so `3^40` is a magnitude horizon ~7 orders above where the
  sample collapse first appears; **`C13_law` (∀-prime boundary law) is REFUSED as
  a theorem — a named OPEN `Prop` `C13_Law_Open`, empirical 6/6 only** (blockers:
  infinite/undecidable ∀; `symOf` not kernel-checkable — `decide` overflows
  `maxRecDepth` on `symOf 191`; `p.Prime`/`Nat.log10` need mathlib). All
  mathlib-free, `sorry`/axiom-free, NONE bricks, compiled direct EXIT 0; per-module
  `data.json` carries `author: "D. Fox"`. Prove NOTHING new; no YM/mass-gap/
  Surface-#1 claim.
- **H1 AXIOM-DERIVED PACKAGING — `Towers/YM/Hw1_Surface.lean` (2026-06-01; full
  detail → `docs/CHANGELOG.md`).** H1 (`w1 β₀ < 1/7`) is DERIVED from two disclosed
  OPEN `[NEEDS_LEMMA]` axioms (`w1_eq_weyl`, `w1_weyl_beta0_lt`), made VISIBLE in
  `#print axioms` — NOT proved, NOT hidden in a `sorry`. `lattice_decay_conditional`
  threads `hw1` + two further OPEN inputs to a LATTICE two-point decay shape
  (necessary-not-sufficient; does NOT close Surface #1). SORRY: 0; NOT a brick.
  Surface #1 / YM stay OPEN; NO mass-gap / μ>0 / Clay claim.
- **Older 2026-06-01 leaves (full detail → `docs/CHANGELOG.md`):** Bost-violation
  check `Towers/BostViolations/Compute.lean` (computable `C_rat` over ℚ,
  `BostViolations_12 = []` — no violations; conjecture stays OPEN); Hodge
  `SMap.lean` / `Twelve.lean` / `Defs.lean` (12-curve `exceptional_12` + real
  M4-certified `S_14`, `opaque S` per-curve set; `TwelveViolation_Surface` OPEN,
  unasserted; α₀ = 299+π/10 is ONE constant, NOT a per-`d` family — no
  fabrication); compiling `CanonicalSurfaces` registries split `Towers/YM/` +
  `Towers/NS/` (`YM_Clay_Open`, `NS_Open` — name/group only, discharge nothing).
  All classical trio, SORRY: 0, prove NOTHING new.
- **VACUOUS SURFACE PURGE + SORRY PURGE (2026-05-31; detail → `docs/CHANGELOG.md`).**
  Every live `sorry` proof-term in `Towers/` → named open `Prop` hypothesis
  (`theorem foo := by sorry` ⟹ `def Foo_Surface : Prop` + `theorem foo (h) := h`);
  BSD `axiom`s → hypotheses. Audit: 11 named `*_Surface` Props were VACUOUS under
  stand-in defs (2 fully-vacuous files → `Towers/Deprecated/`, 9 flagged in
  `Attempts/`); 6 GENUINE open surfaces (4 YM, 2 NS) indexed by the split
  registries above. Grep: 0 bare `sorry`/`axiom`/`admit` proof-terms. Logical
  hygiene only — discharges NO surface. SORRY: 0; classical trio.
- **NS Tower 540 — weak→strong chain, Phases 1–6 COMPLETE, FROZEN at the Clay
  boundary (Status: Open).** Milestone `NS-540-phase6-clay-boundary` @ checkpoint
  `c5f29fb4390e5dda83ffdbfcae5dea2333cf5c12`. Both Clay surfaces stay OPEN:
  Surface #1 global regularity (`global_smooth_exists : Prop`, named hypothesis,
  classical trio) and Surface #2 weak existence (`weak_solution_exists`, HONEST
  combinator over the MODELED `WeakNS` surrogate, nonlinear term dropped — NOT
  literal Leray–Hopf). Per-phase detail → `docs/CHANGELOG.md` + `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- **YM wall series** (Wall251b–Wall263, Wall262a, S4Numerics,
  WilsonPositivitySU2, EntropyBound, RiemannianGeometry) — all bricks, in BRICKS,
  `sorry`-free, classical trio. Each proves NO YM result, discharges NO open
  surface, makes NO mass-gap / μ>0 / Surface-#1 claim. Full per-wall index →
  `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **YM Transfer / polymer / positivity / measure scaffolding** (NONE bricks,
  classical trio) — real SU(3) Haar stack, integral transfer `T_L` with
  `‖T_L‖ ≤ 1`, Wilson positivity, cluster-expansion `polymerActivity`. Every
  lemma is necessary-not-sufficient; the spectral lower bound stays OPEN as the
  named open-surface `Transfer.kotecky_preiss_criterion` (a `Prop` hypothesis
  post-purge, formerly a disclaimed `sorry`). NO mass-gap / Surface-#1 claim.
  Detail → `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Wall 574 `[YM1]`** (`Towers/YM/MassGap574.lean`) — `YM_mass_gap` elaborates
  against the real Step-4/5 `H` / `spectrum_bound` and now threads the named-open
  surface `YM_mass_gap_Surface` (a `Prop` hypothesis post-purge, formerly a
  `sorry`); OPEN, INVARIANT-LOCKED, NOT in BRICKS. `H = wilsonAction U • 𝟙` is
  the scalar shadow, NOT the real Wilson transfer operator — no mass-gap claim.
  (The companion `YM_mass_gap_nontrivial` discharges `hpos` for non-trivial `U`
  and is `sorry`-free, but only over the same scalar shadow.) NB: some in-file
  docstrings still say "keeps its `sorry`" — stale prose, not the proof-term.
- **Registered YM walls** (tagged, lake-gated, NOT in BRICKS): 571-B
  `[YM1-LB-Core]`, 572 `[YM1-LB-Real]`, 573 `[YM1-GR]`, 575 `[YM1-SB]`. All
  classical trio.
- **Geometry / Hodge leaves** (NOT bricks): `Wall264_H4Vertices.lean` (600-cell
  vertex geometry, machine-checked) and `Towers/Hodge/ZoeComparisonTest.lean`
  (HODGE_STATUS: OPEN, conditional reduction over the named-open
  `AnalyticObstruction`). Detail → `docs/CHANGELOG.md`; prior superseded Hodge
  work (Lemma 7.6, M* Transform) is retracted there.
- **Axiom debt:** `[]` on `TheoremaAureum.main_theorem` (also `H2_WeilTransfer`,
  `M9_WeilTransfer_All`). Every landed brick is classical-trio-only.
- **Mathlib:** v4.12.0 only. **YM Surface #1: OPEN** — no `m > 0` claim while
  the `sorry` stands.
- **Wall count:** the BRICKS array in `scripts/check-towers.sh`
  (`${#BRICKS[@]}`) is the source of truth, not this file.
- **Deferred:** 24 OS/KP modules unregistered; `.lean` files kept on disk, await
  Wall 570+/574 with the real SU(3) `H`.

## Locked invariants (every batch must hold these)

- Axiom footprint = classical trio `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`;
  no new research-grade axioms.
- Mathlib v4.12.0 only; no `sorry` / `admit` / `sorryAx` in any landed brick.
- YM and NS towers stay `Status: Open` in `docs/ROADMAP.md`; Surface #1 and
  Surface #2 stay OPEN. "Surface #1 CLOSED" / "μ > 0" / "removes the Attempts
  sorry" / "Mass Gap proven" claims are REFUSED — every YM Measure-surface
  brick is trivially or vacuously true under the Dirac haar stand-in
  (`T_OS = 0` / `T_real = 0`), NOT under any real Wilson transfer operator.
- `kotecky_preiss_criterion` stays OPEN in
  `Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean` — a named open-surface hypothesis
  post-purge (formerly a `sorry`); invariant-locked, do not discharge.
- **NS FREEZE.** `Towers/NS/*` is FROZEN at the Clay boundary (milestone
  `NS-540-phase6-clay-boundary`). NO further commits to `Towers/NS/` without an
  explicit unfreeze order from the user. Surface #1 (`global_smooth_exists`) and
  Surface #2 (modeled `weak_solution_exists`) stay OPEN; "NS solved" /
  "regularity proven" / "weak solutions exist (literally)" claims are REFUSED.
  - **Unfreeze exception (2026-05-31): `Towers/NS/Wall300_Scaffold.lean`** added
    under an EXPLICIT user unfreeze order. HONEST CONDITIONAL combinator
    `navier_stokes_global_regularity` threading three named open surfaces (weak
    existence, local regularity, global continuation) through
    `Regularity.weak_implies_strong` to a MODELED global-smoothness shape.
    SORRY: 0, axiom-free, NOT a brick. Proves NO regularity; Surfaces #1/#2 stay
    OPEN. NS otherwise still frozen.
  - **Unfreeze exception (2026-06-01): `Towers/NS/CanonicalSurfaces.lean`** added
    under an EXPLICIT user unfreeze order. Purely ADDITIVE registry — `def
    NS_Open : Prop` that NAMES/groups the two genuine NS open surfaces
    (`enstrophy_bound_global_Surface`, `leray_proj_ker_eq_grad_Surface`);
    imports/modifies no frozen NS proof. SORRY: 0, classical trio, NOT a brick.
    Discharges NOTHING; Surfaces #1/#2 stay OPEN. NS otherwise still frozen.
- **Infra (in progress).** Disabling the `towers-build` auto-run and permanently
  locking the mathlib `v4.12.0` pin is tracked as a background Project Task
  (#294); until it lands, every boot/merge can still wipe the pin and require
  the manual recovery in "Operational gotchas".

## Operational gotchas

- **Git-tag creation is restricted for the main agent.** `git tag` (and other
  git writes) are blocked with "Destructive git operations are not allowed in
  the main agent" — they must go through a background Project Task. This repo's
  working convention is therefore to track milestones as **prose + SHA** in
  `replit.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` / `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (e.g. "YM frozen at
  `c8f6a7ed`", "milestone `NS-540-phase2b-stokes` @ checkpoint `f4becd5`"),
  NOT as literal git refs. Replit checkpoints already capture the merged state.
- **Do NOT run `towers-build` / `lake update` casually.** Both re-clone the
  vendored mathlib checkout and wipe its oleans, requiring a `lake-recovery`
  (`lake exe cache get`) pass. Verify bricks via direct `lake env lean <file>`
  + `#print axioms` — **but `lake env` is ALSO destructive when the
  `v4.12.0` tag is missing.** `lake env` re-resolves `inputRev: v4.12.0` from
  the mathlib git; if the tag does not resolve it fetches from remote and wipes
  the oleans, exactly like `lake update` (confirmed 2026-05-30). So BEFORE any
  `lake env lean`, assert `git -C lean-proof-towers/.lake/packages/mathlib
  rev-parse v4.12.0` succeeds. Recovery if wiped: `scripts/restore-lake-git.sh`
  (run it TWICE — first run restores `.git` at the pinned rev, second run
  rehydrates the empty worktree via its `git checkout -- .` heal), then recreate
  the tag (`git -C lean-proof-towers/.lake/packages/mathlib tag -f v4.12.0
  809c3fb3b5c8f5d7dace56e200b426187516535a`), then run
  `scripts/fetch-mathlib-oleans.sh` to re-download the oleans.
- The destructive mathlib re-clone is triggered when the restore-tar's vendored
  mathlib `.git` lacks the `v4.12.0` tag (lake fetches from remote to resolve
  `inputRev: v4.12.0`). Fix: recreate the tag locally after any
  `restore-lake-git.sh` worktree rebuild —
  `git -C .lake/packages/mathlib tag v4.12.0 <HEAD>` (manifest `rev` already =
  HEAD). It is NOT persisted in the restore tar.
- **Direct-lean verify bypass.** When the `v4.12.0` tag is unresolved (so `lake
  env` would wipe the oleans) but the oleans are intact, compile a brick with a
  hand-built `LEAN_PATH` over each `.lake/packages/*/.lake/build/lib` +
  `.lake/build/lib` and invoke `lean <file>` directly from `lean-proof-towers/`.

## User preferences

- Ship clean: no `sorryAx`, no `sorry` / `admit` in any landed/registered brick.
- Be honest about scope — never overstate a placeholder/stand-in as a real
  result (no false "mass gap proven" / "Surface #1 closed" claims).

## theorema-certs dashboard

Web artifact (`artifacts/theorema-certs`) — the certificate-ledger dashboard.
Has e2e Playwright specs under `tests/e2e/`. Run a spec with:
`PLAYWRIGHT_MANAGED_WEB_SERVER=1 pnpm --filter @workspace/theorema-certs exec playwright test <name>`.
Typecheck with `pnpm --filter @workspace/theorema-certs run typecheck` (NOT
`build`, which needs workflow-provided `PORT`/`BASE_PATH`). The dashboard
consumes generated hooks from `@workspace/api-client-react`; after editing the
OpenAPI spec run `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen`, and if the
consuming typecheck reports missing exports rebuild the composite lib
declarations with `pnpm run typecheck:libs` (its `exports` resolves through the
project-reference `dist/*.d.ts`, which can go stale).

**`/v2.3` page (`src/pages/v23.tsx`).** The v2.3 "paper" view — three sections:
Build Table (four H4 modules, real file SHA-256 + honest status
LOCKED/EMPIRICAL/CONJECTURE), Data (the four `Towers/YM/*.data.json` rendered
verbatim via `?raw`), Colophon (`docs/COLOPHON.md` verbatim via the `@docs`
alias). Honesty-locked: C13 law shown as CONJECTURE (6/6 empirical), P5
`digit_len 14`, H4Core manifest SHA flagged as a RECORD hash (not the file
hash). Wired in `App.tsx` + sidebar nav.

## Wall256 — SU(3) conditional reduction (research phase)

`Towers/YM/Wall256_Scaffold.lean` (commit `8eeab54`, tracked on main, NOT a
brick). Classical trio, 0 `sorry`, YM_STATUS: OPEN. **Conditional reduction
only** — `strong_coupling_decay_of_open_inputs` threads three explicit OPEN
hypotheses through the genuine `Wall256Note.kp_summable_of_truncatedActivity`
comparison test to an abstract two-point decay shape. Proves NO mass gap, NO
`μ > 0`, NO Surface-#1; LATTICE scope, NOT Clay. The conclusion is valid ONLY
IF the three hypotheses hold; none is discharged or scheduled:

1. **`w1_SU3_bound`** (`hw1 : w1 < 1/7`) — strict single-site SU(3) Haar weight
   bound. STRICT matters: `= 1/7` gives `I = log 7` and a divergent entropy
   series. In the scaffold `w1 : ℝ` is abstract, so `hw1` is formally trivial;
   a real `w1 := ∫_{SU(3)} exp(-β·S) d haarSU3` needs SU(3) character theory or
   verified cubature, absent from mathlib v4.12.0.
2. **`OS_cluster_bound`** (`hOS : w1 < 1/7 → TruncatedActivityBound a`) — the
   Osterwalder–Seiler strong-coupling Ursell/cluster step (NOT OS reflection
   positivity).
3. **`KP_implies_decay`** (`h_bridge`) — the Brydges–Federbush step:
   KP-summability ⟹ geometric two-point clustering with `ρ < 1` (Friedli–Velenik
   2018, Ch. 5; absent from mathlib v4.12.0).
